# QuestItem

> QuestItem addon for vanilla World of Warcraft.

If you have ever had a quest item you have no idea which quest it belongs to,
and if it safe to destroy, this AddOn is for you. QuestItem stores an in-game
database over quest items and tell you which quest they belong to.

QuestItem now has a configuration screen you can access by typing `/questitem`
or `/qi` at the chat prompt. Here you can configure some of the functionallity
as well as do manual mapping of unidentified items.
If you've made a mistake with a manual mapping, you can change it by holding
down the Shift key while clicking.

QuestHistory addon is recommended.
